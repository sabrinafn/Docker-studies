Key Learnings:

- Learned how to write a minimal Python Dockerfile:
    - FROM python:latest to install the latest version of python
    - COPY to copy local files into the container
    - CMD to set the commands to be executed when running the container

- Understand that Python code can run inside a container independent of the Python that is installed in my machine

- Learned to build and run the container with docker build and docker run

- Gained basic understanding of container layers (base image + copied files)
