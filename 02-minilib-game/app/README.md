**So Long** <br>

So Long is a 2D game project built with the MiniLibX library, and its theme is inspired by the banana cat meme. In the game, you control a banana cat that navigates through walls, collects milk bottles, and must find the exit â€” a blender! The project focuses on map validation, image rendering, and handling user input while maintaining the fun and quirky vibe of the meme.
